Description: An estimator of the orientation of an inertial measurement unit 
    (IMU) with a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope. You provide 'imuf'
    the IMU's accelerometer and gyroscope readings, time duration, its initial 
    orientation, and a "gain" factor. 'imuf' provides an estimate of the IMU's 
    final orientation.
