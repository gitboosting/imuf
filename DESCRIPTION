Description: An estimator of the orientation of an inertial measurement unit 
    with a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope. You provide the
    accelerometer and gyroscope readings, time duration, the initial 
    orientation, and a "gain" factor. We provide an estimate of the final 
    orientation.
